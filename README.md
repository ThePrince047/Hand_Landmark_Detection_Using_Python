# 🖐️ Hand Landmark Detection GUI with Webcam

This Python project creates a GUI application that detects and displays hand landmarks in real-time using your webcam. It uses OpenCV for video capture, Tkinter for the interface, and `cvzone` (built on top of MediaPipe) for detecting hand landmarks.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Real-time hand detection using your webcam  
- ✅ Displays hand landmarks (21 keypoints) with green circles  
- ✅ Simple GUI using Tkinter  
- ✅ Exit button to safely close the app  
- ✅ Smooth video frame updates inside the GUI

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.7+**
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) – for webcam and image processing
- [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) – GUI framework
- [Pillow (PIL)](https://python-pillow.org/) – image handling for Tkinter
- [cvzone](https://github.com/cvzone/cvzone) – simplified computer vision (uses MediaPipe under the hood)
